# Forta Labelled Datasets

Publicly available datasets of suspicious Web3 activity is limited on all Forta supported chains. Without this, it can be a challenge to create or evaluate machine-learning based solutions.

Inspired by https://cryptoscamdb.org/ and https://www.web3rekt.com/ that keeps track of crypto scams in an open source database, this repository aims to maintain and share Web3 threat related datasets with the Forta community. Contributions are welcome!

## Datasets

### ChainId 1: Ethereum

* `labels/1/malicious_smart_contracts.csv`: Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet (chainId: 1) by malicious addresses with etherscan labels `exploit`, `heist`, and `phish-hack`.

### ChainId 10: Optimism

* `labels/10/malicious_smart_contracts.csv`: Smart contracts deployed on Optimism (chainId: 10) by malicious addresses with optimistic.etherscan label `exploit`.
