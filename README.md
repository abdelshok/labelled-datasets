# Forta Labelled Datasets

Publicly available datasets of suspicious Web3 activity is limited on all Forta supported chains. Without this, it can be a challenge to create or evaluate machine-learning based solutions.

Inspired by https://cryptoscamdb.org/ and https://www.web3rekt.com/ that keeps track of crypto scams in an open source database, this repository aims to maintain and share Web3 threat related datasets with the Forta community. Contributions are welcome!

## Datasets

* `malicious_smart_contracts.csv`: Smart contracts deployed by malicious addresses with etherscan labels `exploit`, `heist`, and `phish-hack`.
